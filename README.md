## Architecture Overview

## Database Design

### The schema covers the following key entities



## N-Tier Architecture  
From an MVC perspective:
- **View** - Client/UI
- **Controller** - Web Server and Application/Business Logic
- **Model** - Data and Database Layers

Through the FastAPI server, the client calls the routers which interact with Security and Service Layers.  
The two services on their side, use the Pydantic models and interact with the Database via Database Connector.


## API Documentation
Refer to the FastAPI swagger for the backend API docs. - http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

## Testing
   The tests are written using the `pytest` framework.
   All tests are located in E-LEARNING-APP/tests/
